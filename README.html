This is the README for models associated with the paper:

 Gorin M, Tsitoura C, Kahan A, Watznauer K, Drose DR, Arts M, Mathar
 R, O'Connor S, Hanganu-Op (2016) Interdependent Conductances Drive
 Infraslow Intrinsic Rhythmogenesis in a Subset of Accessory Olfactory
 Bulb Projection Neurons. J Neurosci 36:3127-44

These files were contributed by Simon O'Connor.

These models were originally developed under neuroConstruct from which
these NEURON files were generated.

Running under NEURON (original platform was linux however mac and
mswin also work):
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You can run by autolaunching from ModelDB or downloading and
extracting this archive, and then compiling the mod files, and running
mosinit.hoc.  For more details on this procedure see the help page:

Pressing the button to produce the (top of) Figure 10Hii simulation
takes about 2 1/2 minutes on a 2012 MacBook Pro and should generate a
figure that looks like this:

<img src="./screenshot1.png" alt="screenshot 1" width="550">

If you click on the button to produce the (top of) Figure 10Hiii
button also takes about 2 1/2 minutes and should generate a graph like
this:
